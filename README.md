# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1:
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. 
In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided,
focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.


## DATASET
The dataset used for this task is . 
[world_population_dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.


## Tools and Libraires used:
.Jupyter notebook
.Pandas
.Numpy
.Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable
